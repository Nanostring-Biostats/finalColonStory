        "Description": "The main function of the colon is to remove water, nutrients, and electrolytes from partially digested food, thus concentrating stool prior to defecation. To support this function, the colon has four main layers: mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa, and serosa.\n\nThe mucosal layer is a smooth surface punctuated by crypts. It is divided into three main parts: the epithelium, the lamina propria, and the muscularis mucosae. In the epithelial layer, enterocytes act as a barrier separating the lumen of the colon from the colon tissue, enteroendocrine cells absorb water and produce hormones and peptides, and goblet cells secrete mucus. Beneath these, the lamina propria is a layer of connective tissue which helps maintain the integrity of the mucosa, and contains many immune cells including plasma cells, lymphocytes, macrophages, granulocytes, and mast cells. The bottom of the mucosal layer is the muscularis mucosae, a thin layer of smooth muscle tissue.\n\nSurrounding the mucosal layer, the submucosa contains connective tissue, nerves, blood vessels and collagen fibers that help maintain the shape of the colon. The submucosa also contains colonic patches, which are lymphoid follicles that regulate immune homeostasis in the context of the colonic microbiome and food-derived antigens. The colonic patches are organized into B cell-containing germinal centers and T cell zones to regulate T and B cell activation and function. Surrounding the submucosa is the muscularis externa, which consists of circular and longitudinal muscles that help move digested food through the colon. Finally, the serosa is a loose connective tissue outside of the muscularis externa which prevents damage from friction as the colon moves.\n\nThis colon tissue was visualized with antibodies to PanCK (epithelial cells), CD45 (​immune cells), 5-HT (enteroendocrine cells including Paneth cells) and SYTO83 (nuclei).", 
        "Footer": "Hints:\n* If you select the square on the image above, a region containing the colon wall is highlighted on the image to enable orientation.\n* If select the colonic patch, three representative colonic patches are highlighted on the image.\n* You can toggle the Regions of Interest (ROIs) that were molecularly profiled by clicking on the respective data layers (left-hand side of screen).\n* You can change the morphology markers being displayed by selecting channel groups – all markers or individual markers can be displayed. Switching to an individual marker can make it easier to see small ROIs.\n* The “All data layers” category allows you to toggle between selecting all data layers and selecting no data layers. A single click can unselect all data layers, allowing easy selection of a single data layer (If any layers are unselected, the first click will select all layers, the second click will unselect all).",

For this colon data, the cell types are as defined by the [**Gut Cell Atlas**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03852-1). In this graph, each column is a single ROI, and each structure has a unique composition of cell types. By comparing the cellular composition of different ROI types, we can learn about the biological activity within the colon. For example, IgA-producing plasma cells were observed in the lamina propria where their antibodies can be secreted into the lumen of the intestine. The naïve and memory B cells are co-localized along with T cells and antigen-presenting cells, where they can maintain long-lasting immunity and respond to novel pathogens.\n\nThe enteroendocrine and epithelial ROIs demonstrate the power of enrichment by segmentation. The enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are hormone-producing cells that regulate nutrient absorption and are found in the epithelium. They were profiled in the geometric epithelium ROIs, but since the transcriptional profile is averaged from many cell types in the epithelium, the enteroendocrine cell signature is reduced. By contrast, a subset of EECs express 5-HT, which was used as a morphology marker to define the EEC compartment, so the transcriptional profile of those ROIs consists almost entirely of EECs.",

For example, we see that many genes associated with B cell homing (CCL19, CCL21, and CXCL13) and maturation (MS4A1/CD20 and BLK) are expressed in the lymphoid structures, which are the site of B cell homing, activation, and maturation. The lamina propria is where B cells (now matured into plasma cells) secrete antibodies that protect the colon against microbes and thus play an important role in maintaining gut homeostasis. We can see evidence of this antibody-associated gene expression in the lamina propria by enrichment of IGHA1, JCHAIN, IGLL5, and IGKC.",
